== Issues and Pull Requests

* For *small* changes or quick fixes, a simple https://github.com/jgriff/{image-name}/pulls[pull request] is sufficient.

* For *non-trivial* changes or bug reports, please file an https://github.com/jgriff/{image-name}/issues[issue] _before_ submitting a pull request.

* For *substantial* changes, or to discuss a feature request, prefix your issue with "RFC:" (Request For Comment) and tag it with the label https://github.com/jgriff/{image-name}/labels/rfc[`rfc`].

== Development Builds

For local dev builds, the term `dev` is used in place of the link:RELEASES.adoc[release tag] for the final image tag.

There are `make` targets for each `build` and `test` variant.

|===
|Make Target |Description

|`build`
|Builds local image tagged as: `<image>:dev`

|`test`
|Runs unit tests against image tag: `<image>:dev`

|`build_latest`
|Builds local image tagged as: `<image>:latest`

|`test_latest`
|Runs unit tests against image: `<image>:latest`
|===

where:

* `<image>` defaults to `{image-name}`


=== Overriding the Image Name

Sometimes, you may need to push your dev images to another (private) registry for integration testing or other uses.  In those scenarios, you can simply pass an `IMAGE` argument to `make` to set it to your custom image name (without the tag).

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
make build IMAGE=my-registry/{image-name}
----
Works with any target, such as `test`:
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
make test IMAGE=my-registry/{image-name}
----
